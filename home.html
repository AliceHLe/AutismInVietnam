        <br>
        <br>
        <p>There are approximately 1 million autistic children in Vietnam and 8 million people get directly affected, estimated by professionals. The majority of the 1 million autistic children in Vietnam haven't received proper diagnosis, thereby not getting enough help, care, treatment, and education that can significantly impact one's happiness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Symptoms start appearing at the age of 2. The earlier an autistic child is diagnosed and received intervention, the better the life quality of the child later on.</p>
