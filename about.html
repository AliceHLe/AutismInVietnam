        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complex developmental disorder that affects one’s social, communication, and behavioral ability. Being a spectrum disorder with symptoms range from mild to severe, ASD’s effect on each person is distinct. Therefore, not every autistic person is the same.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "left">What are the symptoms?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The types and severity of symptoms vary among people. Autistic people typically engage in repetitive behaviors such as fidgeting, hand-flapping to sticking to routines and becoming very attached to an object. Moreover,  people diagnosed with ASD have difficulty interacting with others for their inability to read nonverbal cues and express themselves fully. They are also prone to feel overloaded by sudden changes in the environment, especially noises.</p>
